# Mice Protein Analysis

**Author:** Arsil Pathan  
**Project:** Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction on Mice Protein Dataset

This project explores various clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques applied to the Mice Protein dataset.  
It includes methods like K-Means, Kernel K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Models, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, SVD, and KPCA.  
The notebook demonstrates how unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures and groupings in biological data.
